## My process ‚å®

1. First I started thinking and making the HTML structure of the page, from the top to bottom.  
2. Therefore I made the header first, separating between navbar and personal information.  
3. Then I did the main part of the page, separating between product and description. Both are components because I realized they needed to share information between themselves.
