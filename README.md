## My process ‚å®

1. First I started thinking and making the HTML structure of the page, from the top to bottom.  
2. Therefore I made the header first, separating between navbar and personal information.  
3. Then I did the main part of the page, separating between product and description. Both are components because I realized they needed to share information between themselves.

### Built with ‚öô

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- TailwindCSS framework
- Sass pre-processor
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned üìö

#### CSS
- Use the order property - flexbox  
- More knowledge about building responsive websites
- Change the color of elements that has been highlighted by the user
#### HTML
- Improvement of my thinking logic in building the website structure right at the beginning of the entire building process  
#### JavaScript
- Create a modal with pure javascript
#### React.js
- To be more used to using components
- Understand how React Contexts work
- Practice with React Hooks

### Continued development üéØ

- Refine my knowledge of create responsive pages
- Improve the use of the React Contexts
- Create modals more easily.

### Useful resources ‚ú®

- [Responsive Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/responsive-viewer/inmopeiepgfljkpkidclfgbgbmfcennb?hl=en) - This helped me to viewing my page on different screens at once. I really liked this extension and I think you too.
